                <h3>How do the farm work</h3>
                <P>
                Kildare farm is a not-for-profit enteprise run on cooperative principles by voluntary and open membership.
                The farmers work the land and the consumers become members of the farm, committing to pay in advance a certain
                amount of money for an agreed period of time, in return, the members receive a box of seasonal vegetables each week
                during our nine month season. The member's money provides a modest income for the farmer and cover the day-to-day running
                cost of the farm.
                </P>

                <h3>How do the membership work</h3>
                <p>
                Membership of the farm involves sharing the risk of a poor harvest with the farmer and the other members. With the CSA model it is 
                understood by all that we share equally in the risk and reward. the due date for signing up for each season is March. Subscription
                for the year must be received before then. You can also become a social member at a cost of 30 euro per household per year, you will be
                invited to all the farm events and will have an opportunity to participate in the running of the farm and become part of the farm community.
                you can also take part in volunteering in any way that suits you.
