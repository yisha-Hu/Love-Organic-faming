                <p>
                    Organic farming benefits our health in many ways, one of the most significant benefits is 
                    reducing exposure to harmful chemicals, it also reducing synthetic fertilizers and pesticides 
                    link to cancer, congenital diabilities and other health problems. This benefits everyone including
                    children who are still developing their immune systems and maybe more susceptible to the effects of pesticides
                    than adults

                    Organic farming benefits our enviroment as it is much more sustainable than traditional farming, the practices of organic
                    farming rely on natural inputs like compost and manure instead of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, this means that organic farming reducces
                    fossil fuel consumpiton thus reducing pollution in our air and water which linked to climate change.
